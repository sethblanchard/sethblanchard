In the offseason the spectacle of professional football is replaced with that of the business of the NFL. Players are cut, signed, drafted and retire.  In order to have an informed opinion[1] on our teams offseason dealings we need to know how good our team was last season. Not what their record was, but how good they really were. Are 'We' just missing one piece? Should we make trades or bottom out to acquire more or better draft picks? These decisions should be made with a solid grasp of the teams actual performance in hand. So if wins and losses don't tell us how well our team performed, what will? 

# Enter Pythagoras

If wins don't tell us how good our team is what does? Point Differential. *Statistically, it is usually more important how much something happened by then just what happened[2]*. The Pythagorean Expectation takes point differential and turns it into expected the percent of games a team should have won. The Pythagorean Expectation was invented by Bill James for use in Baseball [3] before being translated to Basketball and Football. The Pennants above show a teams point difference (the horizontal line [4]) and the expected win difference (the vertical line). Now you can quickly see how good your team really was last year.

# Weight of Expectation
Now that we see how good teams really were last year, how good is the Pythagorean Expectation at predicting next years performance. The chart below shows the yearly wins - the solid line, read at the year axis - with the expected wins - area above or below the lines, again read at the year axis. Usually if a team won less games than it should have the next year it will win more games and vice versa. 


[Chart]

As you can see the Pythagorean Expectation usually gives a good indication of how your team will do next year. You'll also notice it isn't always right. This is because the Pythagorean Expectation doesn't account for a teams offseason moves, something I'm sure you now have a more informed opinion of.

[4] Right angle to the right mean positive point differential. Right angle to the left means negative point differential.
